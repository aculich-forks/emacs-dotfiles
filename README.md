# Renan's Emacs configuration

This is my emacs configuration structure, I use an tweak every day. This may probably be a good
starting point for people trying to learn Emacs. Most of the configuration is aimed at Emacs Lisp
and Ruby development, with some little stuff for Markdown.

The modularization is probably a good example of how to keep your init files clean and sane.

## Requirements

* Emacs 24 or greater.

## Installation

To install, clone this repo to and run `./setup_dotfiles`. This will create symbolic links from the
repository to the `~/.emacs.d/` directory.

``` git clone https://github.com/rranelli/emacs-dotfiles/ && ./emacs-dotfiles/setup_dotfiles ```

## Other very nice configs

I have started emacs with `emacs-starter-kit`, but `emacs-prelude` and Purcell's
[.emacs.d](https://github.com/purcell/emacs.d) provide many interesting stuff too.
