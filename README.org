* A simple, modular and well organized Emacs configuration.

This is my emacs configuration structure, I use an tweak every day. This may probably be a good
starting point for people trying to learn Emacs. Most of the configuration is aimed at Emacs Lisp
and Ruby development, with some little stuff for Markdown.

The modularization is probably a good example of how to keep your init files clean and sane.

*** Requirements
- Emacs24.3 or greater.

*** Installation
To install, clone this repo to and run =./setup_dotfiles=. This will create symbolic links from the
repository to the =~/.emacs.d/= directory.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
git clone https://github.com/rranelli/emacs-dotfiles/ && ./emacs-dotfiles/setup_dotfiles
#+END_SRC

*** Other very nice configurations.
I have started using Emacs with =emacs-starter-kit=, but =emacs-prelude= and Purcell's
[[https://github.com/purcell/emacs.d][emacs.d]] provides a good soft start.
